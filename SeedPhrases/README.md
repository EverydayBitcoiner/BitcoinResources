1. [Coin Entropy BIP 39 wordlist.pdf](https://github.com/EverydayBitcoiner/BitcoinResources/blob/main/SeedPhrases/Coin%20Entropy%20BIP39%20wordlist.pdf) contains instructions and a BIP39 wordlist for generating seedphrase entropy using coin flips (Note: the final word of either a 12 or 24 word mnemonic seedphrase needs to be calculated to provide a checksum which is beyond the scope of this document).
